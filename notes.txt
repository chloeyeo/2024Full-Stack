page => skip (also used in infinite scroll)
size => limit

blog?page=1&limit=5 <- req.query (we'll just fix limit to 5 so it'll actually just be `blog?page=${page}` something like this)
blog/:userId/comment <- req.params

put nginx on docker for project deployment

rsf tab in webstorm (instead of rafce for react snippets in vscode)

Use tailwind to style entire structure and layout,
to style each individual component use styled-components.

For project just use tailwind only

Go to Network -> Fetch/XHR -> blog -> Preview tab (under preview tab you can see all the blogs coming in
(from request to back from front via axiosInstance.get("/blogs")))

instead of doing double axios to get User from userId in blog instance retrieved from the first axios
= too much axios calls to db
we can instead use populate() of mongoose which allows you to get User instance straightaway
e.g. if we also have comment we may have to do 3 axios calls first to blog, then to user and to comment
instead just use mongoose.populate() to minimize call to db (quick)
mongoose puts all data at once - including all blog,comment,user etc so that it can only get the data once, to minimize call/accessing db
after 16mb mongoose does not work, so we only retrieve some data each time

const blogs = await Blog.find({}).populate({ path: "user" });
after .populate({ path: "user" }); this is like JOIN in mysql so now blog instances have the whole user instance as value
to key user, instead of just userId as value to key user when we didn't add .populate() before.
But now the user password also gets retrieved, so we use select: "email name" ro e.g. just get
email and name from user. select:"-email -name" means select everything/retrieve everything from user EXCEPT email and user
const blogs = await Blog.find({}).populate({
      path: "user",
      select: "email name",
});
Get everything from user except password:
const blogs = await Blog.find({}).populate({
      path: "user",
      select: "-password",
});

if N:N (such as user:product many user to many product) add a table in between so it becomes N:1:N such as user:cart:product
dashboard:image:user (N:1:N) make list of images (content creation)
use ref as foreign key (other schema id) (ref: "model_name_in_db")

page uses skip = from which page to which page will we look at
page starts from 0, so skip(page*7) means we look at first 7 pages from 0*7 = 0 to 6
then it shows pages from 1*7 =7 to 13 i.e. shows another 7 pages
infinite scroll shows the added up version of skip
